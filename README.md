### Further improvements that can be done

Admin section can be separated to another package to avoid confusion.

More methods can be added to admin section so as to get more command over database so as to avoid managing database in backend.

Voting activity can be extended to have an web-mail authentication followed by a selfie option to tighten the security measures as online voting is prone to frauds.
